# Hadoop-Platform-and-Application-Framework
This repository is mainly about the tutorials and assignments that I completed in the Hadoop Platform and Application Framework course taught by University of California San Diego.

## Prerequisite
To follow along this tutorial, you need to:  
1. Download and install the __[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)__ of your operating system.  
2. Download the __[Cloudera QuickStart VM](https://downloads.cloudera.com/demo_vm/virtualbox/cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0-virtualbox.zip)__. Note that the size of this zip file is about 4GB.  
3. Unzip the Cloudera QuickStart VM.  
4. Start VirtualBox and import the cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0-virtualbox.ovf. Note this can take several minutes to complete.  
5. Select quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0 VM and click the start button to launch the VM. If you haven't enabled Virtualization (VT-x) in your BIOS, you will get an error. Restart your PC and enable it. After that launch the VM again. Note this can take several minutes to complete.  
6. Once it is completed, the desktop will appear with a browser and you're all set to start learning Hadoop!
